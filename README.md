## Projects

### MyLeague
#### Owner/Creator

[MyLeague](https://github.com/charleshall1998/LeagueApplication) is a full-stack application developed using Spring Boot, JUnit5, and Angular. Consists of a Springboot-developed REST API that connects to an Angular front-end. It is based around the video game League of Legends and allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on sets of items, runes, and summoner spells. The purpose of this project was the practice utilizing and integrating the tech stack and demonstrate my ability to utilize these technologies.

### Find My Paradise
#### Contributor

[Find My Paradise](https://github.com/Smelser-Squad/FindMyParadise) is a full-stack application developed using Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, and Vue. It is a mock-up of AirBnb, particularly the listing page. I was responsible for the amenities component of the page. The purpose of this project was to practice new technologies and practice working with a team to develop a project using Github as a remote repository as well as use an Agile development process.
