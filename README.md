## Projects

### MyLeague
#### Owner/Creator

[MyLeague](https://github.com/charleshall1998/LeagueApplication) is a full-stack application developed using Spring Boot, JUnit5, and Angular. Consists of a Springboot-developed REST API that connects to an Angular front-end. It is based around the video game League of Legends and allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on sets of items, runes, and summoner spells. The purpose of this project was the practice utilizing and integrating the tech stack and demonstrate my ability to utilize these technologies.
